Capture of the local Among Us executable state

The amonguscapture-gtk project  brings the amonguscapture utility to other platforms by removing the Windows dependent WinForms framework and replacing it with the open-source GTK framework (https://www.gtk.org/).

AmongusCapture-gtk is currently supported under:
* Windows
* Linux

While AmongUsCapture-gtk works under Windows, we recommmend using the [official release](https://github.com/denverquane/amonguscapture).
