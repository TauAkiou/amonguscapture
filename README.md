# amonguscapture-gtk

A GTK port of the amonguscapture utility, primarily for use on non-windows operating systems.

All WinForms code has been ripped out and replaced with GTK Code. Uses GTKSharp.

While this theoretically is meant to be used under Linux, a process reading API must be written from scratch.
